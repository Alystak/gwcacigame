This repository is for the Girls Who Code: Augusta Cyber Institute chapter to see and share code for a simple game. The game helps identify the Core4: Variables, Loops, Conditionals, and Functions

One version uses Python 3.5+

The other version uses Python 3.5+ and the PyGame library (https://www.pygame.org/)
We recommend you install PyGame as an administrator; if your computer only has Python 3, you will only need to do the following from the ..Python\Scripts folder if pip is already installed:

> pip install pygame

> pip show pygame
